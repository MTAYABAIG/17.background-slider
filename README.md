In this project, a simple image slider is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The slider consists of a container that holds multiple slides, each represented by a `<div>` element with a background image.

The CSS code defines the styles for the slider, including its dimensions, positioning, and transitions. It also styles the left and right arrow buttons.

The JavaScript code is responsible for the functionality of the slider. It selects the necessary HTML elements, such as the container, slides, and arrow buttons. The active slide is initially set to the second slide (index 2). Functions are defined to update the background image of the container to match the active slide and apply the "active" class to the corresponding slide.

Event listeners are added to the left and right arrow buttons. When clicked, these buttons update the active slide by decrementing or incrementing the index. The functions for updating the background image and applying the active state to the slide are called accordingly.

By combining the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code, the slider allows the user to navigate through the slides by clicking the arrow buttons, and the background image of the container changes accordingly.

Overall, this project demonstrates a basic implementation of an image slider using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a visually appealing and interactive element on a web page.
